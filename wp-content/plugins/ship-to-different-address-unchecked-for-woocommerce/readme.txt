Make the "Ship to Different Address?" checkbox default to unchecked on the WooCommerce checkout page.

== Description ==

An eCommerce user experience should be as frictionless as possible.  The last thing you want to do is bombard your potential customers with a wall of form fields on the checkout page.

This simple and lightweight plugin hides half of the checkout address fields from view by unchecking the "Ship to Different Address" checkbox.  If someone actually wants to ship to a different address from their billing address, then they can check the box to show all the shipping fields.

To default the "Ship to Different Address" checkbox to unchecked, simply activate this plugin.  To revert and default it to checked once again, simply deactivate this plugin.  No settings page is neccessary for this plugin.
